# Basic Ecommmerce project is built based on Microservices architecture.

This project is my self-learning project. 
I based on [this course](https://www.udemy.com/course/microservices-architecture-and-implementation-on-dotnet/) in Udemy of [Mehmet Ozkaya](https://github.com/mehmetozkaya).
And I'm still enhancing it with:
- Implement new business.
- Apply new structural.
- Apply unit test.
- Apply integration test.

## Getting Started

Here is the structure of project that I capture from the course (I mentioned above).
